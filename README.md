# Evaluating the Determinants of Airbnb Pricing and the Appeal of Locations

## Introduction:
Amid the dynamic domain of short-term housing, Airbnb emerges as a distinguished leader. This analysis probes into the myriad elements that sway the pricing of Airbnb listings and the allure of locations within numerous principal European urban areas. By exploiting an extensive dataset, a Power BI dashboard has been developed to facilitate an interactive exploration and scrutiny of these elements.

## Methodology and Data Preparation:
The approach adopted harnesses the dynamic and interactive visualization prowess of Power BI. Datasets pertaining to individual cities, alongside distinct datasets for weekdays and weekends, were meticulously assembled via Power Query. An elaborate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) procedure was executed to amalgamate these distinct datasets into a singular model, thereby ensuring a dataset that is both comprehensive and devoid of impurities for the ensuing analysis. Paramount to our analysis are filters specific to each city, options for guest accommodations, disparities in pricing between weekdays and weekends, indices of location-based appeal, and the assortment of room types alongside their cleanliness ratings.

## Key Components:
### City Slicers:
Facilitates geographic market analysis by allowing filtering by city, highlighting unique trends and pricing from Amsterdam to Vienna.

#### Cost Cards: 
Displays real-time average listing prices, adjusting to filter changes, offering immediate insight into pricing dynamics.

#### Guest Satisfaction and Cleanliness Ratings: 
Quantifies guest satisfaction and visualizes cleanliness by room type, influencing pricing and preferences.

#### Number of Guests and Vacation Type: 
Analyzes listing capacity and differentiates between weekday and weekend pricing, revealing demand and pricing elasticity.

#### Location Attractiveness Indexes: 
Measures desirability through restaurant and attraction indices, linking them to pricing, highlighting location value.

#### Map Visualization: 
Uses geospatial mapping to show listing clusters, identifying tourist hotspots and areas lacking services.

## Findings:
The analysis unearthed a palpable nexus between the appeal of a location and the pricing of listings. Properties situated in vicinities boasting higher indices of attractions and dining establishments command higher prices, and an augmented guest capacity invariably elevates the listing price. Furthermore, the distribution of room types and their respective cleanliness ratings markedly impact guest preferences and satisfaction, with entire homes or apartments prevailing as the most favoured and highly rated concerning cleanliness.

## Implications:
This investigation reveals several implications for Airbnb hosts. It highlights the pivotal role of competitive pricing, the imperative of upholding exemplary cleanliness standards, and the advantages of promoting properties based on the appeal of their location. For travellers, it sheds light on optimal booking periods and the property types that promise the most value for their expenditure.

## Conclusion:
In summation, our analysis, powered by Power BI, affords a holistic overview of the Airbnb marketplace, furnishing both hosts and travellers with actionable intelligence. It exemplifies the efficacy of data visualization and meticulous data preparation in facilitating informed decision-making within the realm of short-term rentals.
